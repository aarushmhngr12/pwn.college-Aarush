# File Globbing

## Match with ?
practice this yourself! Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, 
but use the ? character instead of c and l in the argument to cd! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Yv52QS9GMLu3iDTYzNNlbkTJmpP.QXyIDO0wiN5AzNzEzW}`

Using the command to get into the directory and usind the command as commanded us .

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$  cd /?ha??eng?
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Yv52QS9GMLu3iDTYzNNlbkTJmpP.QXyIDO0wiN5AzNzEzW}
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$

```
