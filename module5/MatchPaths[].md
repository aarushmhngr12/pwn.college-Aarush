# File Globbing

## Matching Paths with []
we've placed a bunch of files in /challenge/files.
Starting from your home directory, run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into the absolute paths to the file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h files!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{c3cBMena47fb6ulGDe4JuE0CHz1.QX0IDO0wiN5AzNzEzW}`

As told you use /challenge/run and apllying the command.

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{c3cBMena47fb6ulGDe4JuE0CHz1.QX0IDO0wiN5AzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
Using the path we can also find the files.
