# File Globbing

## Tab Completion
This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. 
But you can't type the filename: we used some serious trickery to make sure that you must tab-complete it.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{I0ayjT7roDSkUOBlqZED_OZ9_Hi.0FN0EzNxwiN5AzNzEzW}`

As said to use tab at the end, i used at the end after finding out the files to check.
```bash
ls /challenge
DESCRIPTION.md  pwncollege​
ls /challenge
DESCRIPTION.md  pwncollege​
```
