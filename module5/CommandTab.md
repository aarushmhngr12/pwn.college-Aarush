# File Globbing

## Tab Completion on Commands 
Tab completion is for more than files! You can also tab-complete commands. 
This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag.
Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8E9r4ch243_KPPtb_JhRJxW2U_K.0VN0EzNxwiN5AzNzEzW}`

I wrote pwncollege then pressed tab, it gave me a number.
after pressing enter, it gave me the flag. 

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-10777
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8E9r4ch243_KPPtb_JhRJxW2U_K.0VN0EzNxwiN5AzNzEzW}
