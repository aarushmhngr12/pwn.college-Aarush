### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y_Pm77_PPMr_uWH6TnT_EYJOU3_.0lM3kjNxwiN5AzNzEzW}`

As said to us , to use 3 or less than 3 letters with two globs, so used *p*.

```bash
cd /challenge/files
/challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Y_Pm77_PPMr_uWH6TnT_EYJOU3_.0lM3kjNxwiN5AzNzEzW}
```
