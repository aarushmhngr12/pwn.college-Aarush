# Practicing Piping

## Redirecting Output
you must use this output redirection to write the word PWN (all uppercase) to the filename COLLEGE (all uppercase).

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kTIkj37HN7Rjz9V0jAkybnX9RRi.QX0YTN0wiN5AzNzEzW}`

I did what was told me as in example. like using > for echoing and output

```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{kTIkj37HN7Rjz9V0jAkybnX9RRi.QX0YTN0wiN5AzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
