# Pondering Paths

## The Root
We have to find the flag for the absolute path for/pwn. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cK_cBndUEleN35jNJ8h_CY_6e7F.QX4cTO0wiN5AzNzEzW}`

Thoughts were like to use the command directly /pwn. 

```bash
/pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cK_cBndUEleN35jNJ8h_CY_6e7F.QX4cTO0wiN5AzNzEzW}
```
