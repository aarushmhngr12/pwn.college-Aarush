## Selected Ambient Work  
The symphonic adventure does not end here. On the next floor, a single song keeps echoing through the  
floor, repeating in a haunting loop. Amid the sound, you find a note left by a past candidate. It hints  
that the song holds a secret message, hidden in plain sight, much like how Aphex Twin concealed his  
face within his music with the help of spectrograms.  

To move forward, you must find the message hidden in this sound.  

Note: Separate the words in the flag with _ and make it UPPERCASE. Example:   
citadel{S3L3CT3D_AMB13NT_W0RK}  
### Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{1_LOV3_1DM`
I was stuck on this for a while as I figured out it was morse but it also had beats  
along it. Upon re-examining the spectrogram after numerous times, we saw the text of citadel { with morse in between  
which gave us the hint. I noted the morse in between the brackets to solve it.
