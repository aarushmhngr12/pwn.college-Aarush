## Test of Sweetness 


This floor feels like a digital world. The space is an illusion, all pink and sweet, stretching around  
you in impossible patterns. Here, you are no longer a climber but just another user.   

Ahead, a door glows faintly. It is the only path forward and requires a level of authority you do not  
yet have. Fragments of session memory flicker, hinting at what it might take to gain higher access.

### Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{fru1tc4k3_4nd_c00k13s}`
I read this and thought immediately of cookies.I turned out to be right but the name and the value proved  
to be a setback and after a lot of trying, I figured out the difference between the name and the value and put   
the value as admin to get higher access and hence the flag.
