## Learning Complex Usage
his program allows you to print arbitrary files to the terminal, 
when given the --printfile argument. The argument to the --printfile argument is the path of the flag to read. 

I just tried writing in once like it was said .

```bash
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ ls
flag  g  not-the-flag
$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{IvVnUQWqcNYrFC1YJ0TlEAdrQVd.QX1ITO0wiN5AzNzEzW}

```
