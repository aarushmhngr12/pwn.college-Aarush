# Processes and Jobs

## Starting Background Processes
Here, sleep is actively running in the background, not suspended. Now it's your turn to practice! Launch /challenge/run backgrounded for the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8k8x4WtMnpeyV2SdmUMoVMlCLPD.QX5QDO0wiN5AzNzEzW}`

Running the command with &. 

```bash
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 164
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$


Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{8k8x4WtMnpeyV2SdmUMoVMlCLPD.QX5QDO0wiN5AzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
