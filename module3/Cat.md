# Comprehending Commands

## Cat: not the pet, but the command
Using the 'cat' command for taking out the flag of your home directory. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cy176JIWrvw6r6X-vfbUOnlgiwI.QXxcTN0wiN5AzNzEzW}`

As it was asked to use 'cat' and the command flag, and we know if we want to use home directory we use '~' for it. so directly the ~/flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat ~/flag
pwn.college{cy176JIWrvw6r6X-vfbUOnlgiwI.QXxcTN0wiN5AzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
