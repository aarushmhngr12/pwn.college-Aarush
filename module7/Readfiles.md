# Shell Variables

## Reading Files
use that to read /challenge/read_me into the PWN environment variable, and we'll give you the flag!
The /challenge/read_me will keep changing, so you'll need to read it right into the PWN variable with one command!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sNk1eWqgfB7cVaGld_PC_54o2ck.QXwIDO0wiN5AzNzEzW}`

USed the read command with > to get the files.

```bash
read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{sNk1eWqgfB7cVaGld_PC_54o2ck.QXwIDO0wiN5AzNzEzW}
```
